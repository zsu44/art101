		<h1>Subject of Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
		<p>In this lab, it requires us to make our first own web page using what we learn from the class. Adding url of all the lab we worked on and our pictures.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I was struggled on how to upload the img file and show it correctly in html. The main problem comes with linking the images. I was not sure how to link them correctly.</p>
		<h3>Result</h3>
		<p>Here is the index.html file that I created. This is the File Structure I made:</p>
		<img src ="img/fileStructure.jpg" width = 190>
		<h3>Here is my work evidence</h3>
